###Competition Description
New restaurant sites take large investments of time and capital to get up and running. When the wrong location for a restaurant brand is chosen, the site closes within 18 months and operating losses are incurred. 

Finding a mathematical model to increase the effectiveness of investments in new restaurant sites would allow TFI to invest more in other important business areas, like sustainability, innovation, and training for new employees. Using demographic, real estate, and commercial data, this competition challenges you to predict the annual restaurant sales of 100,000 regional locations.
